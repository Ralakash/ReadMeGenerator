  ## Desription
  
  This is a project that allows a user to answer questions to generate a README.md file. 
  This project was designed to simplify the process of adding a readme file.
  I built this project to showcase an understanding of node.js as well as to help make future readme's consistant.
  I was trying to solve the problem of inconsistant or incomplete readme files.
  I learned a lot about the file system in Node.js as well as how to use the console in more detail.
